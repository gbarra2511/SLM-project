# SLM-project

**motivation** 
This project is based in Dr Raj Dandekar(MIT PhD in Machine learning) teachings. Our goal is to build a production level SLM, but for instance I'm developing and documenting the process of building an slm from scratch. My goal in the future is to uptade this project to a greater model with 100k parameters.

STEPS:

Creating Dataset
Tokenizing the dataset
Creating input target pairs
Creating the SLM archtecture
Setting up for pre training
pre training
Inferences

Althought there is much more than this in the project, like explaining Backpropagation, ReLU and GeLU, the steps of building an slm,etc.
